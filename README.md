# Project Labyrinth

For week 12 of the Technigo frontend developer bootcamp out assignment was to make a game navigating a labyrinth using Redux and api calls.

## The problem

In the beginning of the game we fetch info about the starting position and then post to the direction you choose to go to the api to get an updated reply. The api saves the progress connected to the user name so we added a timestamp to make it more uniqe. Most of the work has been done in pair-programming.

If we have more time we would like to implement a map to see the journey through the labyrinth.
